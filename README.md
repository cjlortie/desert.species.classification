# desert.species.classification
A set of attributes describing the common species within the deserts of Central California.  

The common species sampled within the regional deserts of California by a collaboration of ecologists. The primary goal is to provide a shared index dataframe that lists the accepted abbrevation for species, the latin binomial, the source (native/exotic), and other functional descriptors.

Abbreviation epithets typically use a 2-2 form selecting the first two characters from the latin binomial. However, if there is already an existing abbreviation within database, use a 3-2 selecting the first three characters of the genus from the latin binomial and two from the species name.
